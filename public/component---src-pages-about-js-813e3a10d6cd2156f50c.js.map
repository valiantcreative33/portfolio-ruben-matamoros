I gave a speech as the representative of my class and\n            was awarded with the Advanced Achiever Award. Since then I have\n            designed on a global scale with companies such as Ashley Furniture\n            and Carillon Tower Advisors of Raymond James. With 10 plus years\n            experience in design, now turned a Full-Stack Software Engineer with\n            a focus on Front End Web Development. An innovative problem-solver\n            who is passionate about developing websites and apps, with a focus\n            on mobile-first design and development. Strengths are in creativity,\n            teamwork, and building projects from concept to execution. When I’m\n            not developing, sketching and just crushing pixels I enjoy being\n            active as well after sitting all day. My favorite sports are soccer,\n            martial arts, and bike riding. What I enjoy most of all is traveling\n            and spending time with my beautiful wife and three daughters.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            My clients come to me with a business problem they are struggling\n            with, and I partner with them to develop exciting and flexible\n            marketing collaterals that build brand awareness, promote product\n            benefits, enhance the product's professional appearance; and in turn\n            contribute to sustained values for their business.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Cognizant of the importance of balancing the client's needs and\n            vision with practical and cost-efficient design formats, I strive to\n            develop and design solutions that are inviting and interesting but\n            also mirror the client's core values and mission.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </article>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nconst indexQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n    benchAccounting: file(relativePath: { eq: \"about-page-image.jpg\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1360) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nexport default props => (\n  <StaticQuery\n    query={indexQuery}\n    render={data => (\n      <AboutPage location={props.location} data={data} {...props} />\n    )}\n  />\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
