### A Pull Up Banner for Carillon Tower Advisors, an affiliate of Raymond James Financial.

Privileged to work with the team on this Pull-Up Banner for Carillon Tower Advisors. I shot the photo with my Nikon D5200 using a standard 18-55 mm lens, and was also responsible for all of the photo retouching with Adobe Photoshop. Although it was a team effort, my creative here was the one chosen. This creative was just one of several graphics used for a company convention, along with several other graphics.
