Thomas Ward's Mills 50 District phenomenon is a hipster barbecue joint where global flavorings distinguish the grilled meat specialties. The tacos alone offer flavor tributes to India (butter chicken), Asia (smoked and grilled pork belly with dragon sauce) and Mexico (shrimp, chorizo and cilantro sauce, or chicken, queso fresco and pineapple salsa), not to mention the Texan-ish brisket variety. The service is polished and doting even though guests order at a counter.
